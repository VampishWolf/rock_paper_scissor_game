# This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

#### Clone it, Open it, Play the game! Have fun! Maybe remake it or change it!

This project makes use of the console window present in web browser's Developer Tools.
It can show the output and interact with the user with the console as well as the physical GUI made for the main window.
Initially it requires the user to start the game from console window by typing play() and the game starts.

I have done a minimalist design approach with the texts and labels and a score table avoiding much graphics because hey, we here to spend most of our time trying to figure out how to create things! Designing comes after.
